CPSC 350 Section 3
Assignment #4: Registrar's Office

Source Files:
  1. Registrar.cpp (Contains three classes: Registrar, Student, and Window)
  2. main.cpp

  NOTE: There are also 3 header files, 2 of which contain implementations of
  data structures. ListNode.h defines a node, and a doubly linked list. Queue.h
  uses the doubly linked list implementation to create a queue. The program uses
  both of these data structures extensively.

Description of potential deviations from specifications:

  There are a few things I would like to clarify about how I calculated the statistics
  because I want to ensure that my methods are clear, and don't deviate from how they
  are supposed to be implemented or how I meant them to be implemented. First off, when the
  queue is empty and the last students are sent to visit a window, any windows that may be
  open in addition to that window are not considered idle on that last time unit because there
  is no longer a line. Second, the number of windows that are idle for over 5 minutes calculates
  the number of instances of a window being idle for over 5 minutes at once rather than just
  total. I assume this is implied, but want to clarify. Finally, the mean window idle time
  is calculated by the total window idle time divided by the number of windows.
